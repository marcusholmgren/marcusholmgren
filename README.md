### Hi I'm Marcus 👋👨🏻‍💻

I work as a software developer and builds applications with [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com). I have for the last several years been teaching myself about machine learning and deep learning.


- 🌱 I’m currently learning [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js)
- 📚 I'm also a student in the [Statistics 110: Probability](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110) on [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-probability)
