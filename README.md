### Hi I'm Marcus 👋👨🏻‍💻

I'm a passionate software developer who specializes in creating cutting-edge applications using a diverse range of technologies like [React](https://reactjs.org/) based frameworks like [Remix](https://remix.run), styling with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), build API's with [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com). Programming language's I prefer are [ECMAScript](www.ecma-international.org), [Python](https://www.python.org/), and even [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). I think [Serverless](https://serverlessland.com) workloads are amazing. I'm not just content with the status quo; I'm a lifelong learner who thrives on exploring innovative ways to build applications and solve complex challenges.

I'm an advocate for web technologies, and I specialize in Progressive Web Applications (PWAs). I believe in creating seamless and engaging web experiences that work across devices and platforms, providing users with the best possible interaction with your applications.

When I'm not coding or delving into the world of machine learning, you can find me staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends, sharing knowledge with fellow developers, and always on the lookout for the next exciting challenge in the world of technology.
