### Hi I'm Marcus 👋👨🏻‍💻

I work as a software developer and builds applications in [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com), [ECMAScript](www.ecma-international.org), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [R](https://www.r-project.org/) or [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). I like to learn and explore new ways to build applications and solve problems. This curiosity have lead me to explore data science, machine learning and deep learning for the last couple of years.


- 🌱 I’m currently learning [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js)
